# Rules for SBCC

The Single Board Computer Competition (SBCC) has set the following rules to ensure fair and equal competition among participants. First, Apple M1 and M2 chips are off-limits. Additionally, participants must use a minimum of 4 sockets and run MPI. The power limit is set at 250 watts, and the cost limit is $6,000 MSRP (American MSRP).

The competition will include benchmarking challenges, such as the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) and High-Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG), which must be run with MPI. Participants must also complete the Intel MPI benchmarks. There is a application challenge, which will be the Graph500 benchmark. Here are two reference implementations: [Official](https://github.com/graph500/graph500) and [ParallelFirstSearch](https://github.com/du00d/ParallelFirstSearch).

The SBCC competition will be held virtually, with the option for in-person participation. The event will take place on May 25th.

To measure efficiency, the GFLOPS/watt for the chips being tested will be recorded based on HPL results. A sample result of what is expected can be found here: https://github.com/deater/performance_results. We just want a table with the chips and their gflops/watt.

The SBCC competition presents a unique opportunity for participants to showcase their skills in building and optimizing single board computer clusters, while also gaining valuable knowledge and experience in the field of high-performance computing.
